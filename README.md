### ICP_TEST
#### this program is just for testing.
- implement point to point and point to plane 2D ICP using ceres.
- check the unobservability based on hessian matrix.
- calculating covariance with removing unobservable component.

- And there is CSM package in Andrea Censi personal website which contains pl-icp and covariance code.
